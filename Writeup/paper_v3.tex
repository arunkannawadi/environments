\begin{abstract}
According to our current understanding, galaxy shapes and morphologies should depend on various factors such as the local environment. Realistic image simulations for calibration of weak lensing analysis methods that use training samples from the Hubble Space Telescope can therefore be affected by these trends, due to the limited volume of the universe that has been surveyed by Hubble. We will show how redshift slices in a volume-limited subsample of COSMOS can be classified as overdense or underdense (or neither), and how the statistical properties of various morphological parameters such as ellipticity, \sersicn, \btt ratio and color differ in these bins. This study requires a careful distinction between environment effects from large-scale structure, which we do not wish to include in simulations, and general trends in the galaxy population with redshift. We conclude with some guidance for how upcoming surveys can use COSMOS data as the basis for weak lensing simulations without having their conclusions overly affected by cosmic variance.

% \rachel{Overall comment: the figures need a {\em lot} of work.  First,  they should be in the same order as they are referenced in the  text.  Second, they need to be sensibly referenced in the text; you  can't say ``as we see\dots'' without having a clear statement that  we should be looking at Fig.~4 (or whatever).  In all  cases, the font size is way too small, so you should enlarge it.  The rule of thumb for MNRAS and other journals is that the font size  in the figures should appear the same size as the font in the text  of the paper.  (This is true for axis labels, tick labels, and text  in the legend.)  You also need to write good captions, because some  people will not really read the paper, just the captions.  MNRAS
%         does not use the subfigure environment, so you should remove it.  Just have the figures on top of or next to each other, and then in  the caption refer to ``Top panel'' and ``Bottom panel'' or whatever.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{S:intro}

Major surveys such as the Hyper Suprime-Cam \citep[HSC;][]{HSC_Overview}, Dark Energy Survey~\citep[DES;][]{DESC}, the KIlo-Degree Survey~\citep[KIDS;][]{KIDS}, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System~\citep[PanSTARRS;][]{PanSTARRS_2010},
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope~\citep[LSST;][]{LSST_Book}, Euclid\footnote{\url{http://sci.esa.int/euclid/}, \url{http://www.euclid-ec.org}} \citep{EuclidReport},
%(\rachel{cite http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1110.3193L}),
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope~\citep[WFIRST;][]{WFIRST_Final}
%(\rachel{for WFIRST, you should actually cite the Spergel et al report that was on the arxiv in the past year, not Green et al})
are planned to be carried out over the next decade or two that will gather huge amounts of weak lensing data that can be used to constrain cosmological parameters more precisely than ever.
Weak gravitational lensing probes the nature of dark energy through both the growth of structure in the universe with redshift and the dependence of distances on the expansion rate or the Hubble parameter.
However, most of the matter in the universe is made up of dark matter which cannot be detected by most of the standard astronomical/cosmological probes. Weak lensing happens to be the cleanest probe for this purpose.
As light from the background sources passes through the foreground cluster of galaxies and dark matter profiles, the shapes get distorted. Weak lensing also causes magnification in addition to introducing a shear.
%Weak lensing effects need to be removed from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analysis to understand the initial conditions of the universe.

For the upcoming surveys to acheive their promise, the systematic error budget must be below the statistical error budget. This would mean that the systematic errors need to be reduced from their current typical level.
One method that is commonly used to test for the presence of systematics is image simulation. Realistic simulations use samples based on images taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) such as COSMOS or UDF(Ultra Deep Field), which are deep (high redshift) surveys taken over small areas of the sky.
The goal of this work is to understand the systematic uncertainties that might arise due to finite size of these areas when dividing the sample into redshift slices to test for 
shear systematics as a function of redshift.
%In almost all branches of observational cosmology, weak lensing introduces systematic error, in addition to itself being a probe of the dark matter and eventually the large scale structure of the universe.

Previous studies have shown that any shape measurement method that uses second moments cannot be independent of the morphology and substructure of the galaxies involved. ({\bf rephrased from GREAT3}).
Hence, it is important to check any method that is proposed to measure the shape of the galaxies to check against a simulation that generates images as realistic as possible.  
With this in mind, the GREAT3 challenge~\citep{great3} was held with the aim to test and faciliate methods for measuring weak gravitational lensing by analyzing astronomical images.
Software packages like GalSim\footnote{https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim} can generate galaxy images fairly accurately, given realistic input parametes.
The training dataset used in the challenge comes from the COSMOS survey, which we describe in sufficient detail in \S\ref{S:data}.
While providing a good quality (high $S/N$) images to be trained over, there could be some bias introduced due to the survey being a narrow one.
It is known \arun{cite refs.} that the shape and morphology of galaxies depend very much on their local environment. Hence, local overdensities or underdensities
observed in the COSMOS' field of view (FOV) may cause the properties of the galaxies to be associated with the redshift, thus unable to distinguish between redshift evolution and large scale structure.

%The structure of the paper is as follows. In \S\ref{S:data}, we briefly describe the COSMOS catalog that we use for our analysis.
In this paper, we show that these large scale structure effects mentioned are indeed present in the data. The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
In \S\ref{sub:overdensities}, we explain how we identify overdensities and underdensities, volume-limit our data in \S\ref{sub:volumelimiting} and in \S\ref{sub:axisratio},
 we explain how we obtain axis-ratios from the images of the galaxies. Finally, we present our results in \S\ref{S:results} and end with conclusions in \S\ref{S:conclusion}.
\section{Data}
\label{S:data}
%In this analysis, we consider the COSMOS sample of galaxies. 
COSMOS~\citep{COSMOS_overview, COSMOS_generic, COSMOS_Alexie} is a flux-limited, narrow deep field survey covering a contiguous area of $1.64 \text{ deg}^2$ of sky, with images taken using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Wide Field Channel (WFC)
in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). 

We apply the following set of initial cuts to the data, all of which is defined in~\cite{COSMOS_Alexie}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \texttt{MU\_CLASS=1}: Unlike SExtractor's stellar index \texttt{CLASS\_STAR} which is continuous, the \texttt{MU\_MAX} method that compares the peak surface brightness to the background level,
 provides a clear differentiation of galaxies (\texttt{MU\_CLASS=1}) from stars (\texttt{MU\_CLASS=2}) and other spurious objects like cosmic rays (\texttt{MU\_CLASS=3})
 
 \item \texttt{CLEAN=1}: Objects near bright stars or those containing saturated pixels were removed and the rest classify as \emph{clean}.
 
% \item \texttt{GOOD\_ZPHOT\_SOURCE=1}: This cut requires that there be a good photometric redshift, which typically is equivalent to requiring that the galaxy not be located within
%                                       the masked regions of the Subaru $BVIz$ imaging used for photometric redshifts, and that it have a successful match against an object in the Subaru imaging
%                                       \arun{copied from Mandelbaum
%                                         2011.}
 \item \texttt{GOOD\_ZPHOT\_SOURCE =1}: This cut requires that the photometric redshifts be reliable and good enough to draw conclusions about the population. More details on what `good' refers to can be found in \cite{SHERA}
\rachel{Need to rephrase, at least a little.  I recommend being
  briefer and saying to see that paper for more details.} \arun{Done.}
\end{enumerate}
%\rachel{The cuts you just gave are really basic or fundamental ones.  Those should go before any discussion of more complicated derived quantities like redshifts, stellar mass, Sersic fits, etc.}

Precise shape measurements, when compared to ground-based surveys, can be made since the full width half-maximum (FWHM) of the point-spread function (PSF)
is $0.12''$. High resolution images taken through the wide F814W filter (broad \emph{I}), after correcting for the PSF, have led to collection of postage stamp images\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/COSMOS/images/galaxy-postage-stamps/} for the GREAT3 challenge~\citep{great3}, using the procedure described in \cite{SHERA}.
Parametric models to most of these galaxies including \sersicn profile fits, 
2 component bulge+disk fits, axis ratios etc were done for GREAT3 challenge~\citep{great3} using the method described in \cite{Claire_Fits}. This is described briefly in Sec.~\ref{sub:axisratio}.In addition to the ACS/WFC (F814W) imaging, the COSMOS field has also been imaged by Subaru Suprime-Cam ($B_j, V_j, g^+,r^+,i^+,z^+,$ NB816), the
Canada-French Hawaii Telescope (CFHT;$u^*,i^*$) and the KPNO/CTIO ($K_s$) .
	      
Photometric redshifts were determined by~\cite{COSMOS_Photoz_30band}.The accuracy of photometric redshifts for $m_\text{F814W}\le$ 22.5 is $\sigma_{\Delta z} = 0.007(1+z_s)$ and at fainter magnitudes, i.e. $m_\text{F814W}\le$ 24, $\sigma_{\Delta z} = 0.012(1+z_s)$.
The photometric redshift values become noisy beyond $z$ of $1$ for our purposes and the various fits to the galaxies are also not very reliable beyond the apparent magnitude $(m)$ value of 23.5. 
Thus, we will exclude all galaxies that have F814W magnitude greater than 23.5. However, we will use $m_\text{F814W}\le 25.2$ sample in volume-limiting process (cf.~\S\ref{sub:volumelimiting}) to calculate completeness.  We take the $z<1.0$ flux-limited sample to fit redshift distribution models (cf.~\S\ref{sub:overdensities}) and then restrict ourselves to $z\le1$ sample for all further analysis.
% ($S/N \sim 50$ {\bf ?} )
% \rachel{Our catalog has the more up-to-date Ilbert et al. photo-$z$,
%   not the older Mobasher ones.  Need to fix citations. Also, we care
%   about the photo-$z$ accuracy beyond 22.5, so it's important to give
%   some information about it to the depth that we actually use.  Finally, I
%   recommend against mentioning the $S/N$ because the calculation is
%   complicated by the correlated noise, so most people use use
%   magnitude instead of $S/N$.}

Stellar mass estimates were obtained~\citep{COSMOS_XRAY} using the Bayesian code described in~\cite{KEVIN_MSTAR}. Basically, a grid of models that vary in age, star formation history, dust content and metallicity
are constructed to which the observed galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) and the photometric redshift are referenced to. At each grid point, the probability that the 
SED fits the model are calculated and by marginalizing over all the parameters in the grid, the stellar mass probability distribution is obtained. The median of this distribution
is taken as the stellar mass estimate. A Chabrier IMF~\citep{ChabrierIMF} is assumed.
  
We will analyze how the galaxy morphology and intrinsic shape depends on
the environment in which they reside.

\section{Methods}
\label{S:methods}

In order to study the variation in the intrinsic ellipticity distribution and other morphological indicators with environment, there are three main steps to be carried out.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item To identify overdense and underdense environments in our survey from the redshift distribution of galaxies (\S\ref{sub:overdensities}),
 \item To limit the sample such that Malmquist bias is minimized before comparing galaxies in different redshift slices (\S\ref{sub:volumelimiting}),
 \item To estimate the galaxy axis ratios and other morphological indicators such as  \sersic index and Bulge-to-Total ratios (\S\ref{sub:axisratio}).
\end{enumerate}

%\rachel{Here you should put a few introductory sentences about the purpose of this section. Could be something like ``To study the  variation in the intrinsic ellipticity distribution with environment, there are two main steps.  The first is to identify redshift ranges with overdense and underdense environments.  The second is to estimate galaxy axis ratios.  In this section we describe how these two steps were done.''}

\subsection{Finding overdensities}
\label{sub:overdensities}
\begin{figure}
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{redshift_fluxlimited}
  %\caption{\rachel{You show this figure twice.  Why?  The legend needs to say the name of the distribution, not show the functional form.}}
  \caption{Upper panel: Redshift distribution of flux-limited ($m_\text{F814W}\le 23.5$) sample with bins that are 0.05 wide. Two analytical functions with best fit parameters are plotted over it.\

  \label{fig:redshift_fluxlimited}
\end{figure}

%\rachel{I am a bit confused here.  Our initial strategy was as follows: use all galaxies with $F814W<23.5$ or 25.2 to define a redshift distribution that we fit with one of our functional forms, use that to define overdensities, and then later when we're checking
%  the variation of properties with redshift, we restrict to
%  volume-limited subsamples.  But here you seem to be volume-limiting
%  as the first step, which is not really appropriate. The functional
%  forms that people have derived for surveys are predicated on the
%  assumption that they are flux-limited.  What is the justification
%  for volume-limiting first?  if there is none, then we should not be
%  doing it. And then this section will have 3 subsection: finding
%  overdensities, estimating axis ratios, and volume limiting,
%  where we need to explain the two choices (using $B$-band evolution
%  and using no evolution).}

Weak lensing simulations will use galaxies selected in 2D redshift slices and
we split our sample in a similar way to assign overdensities.

%In a wide-field survey, regions of overdensities are selected  identified by computing 3-dimensional comoving densities. But in narrow field surveys like COSMOS, previous work {\bf cite } have shown
%that regions of overdensities can be identified from a 1-dimensional histogram of redshifts, at least for low redshifts. 
%\rachel{This is not entirely the point.  As we've discussed, the point
%  is that we do not care about 3d densities for this particular science.  Weak lensing simulations
%  will use galaxies selected in 2d slices, and hence we will simply do
 % it that way as well.  But we use the comparison with a 3d analysis
 % as a test of our method.}

%\rachel{I thought we were only going up to $z=0.85$ but here you say $1$?}
%For our sample of galaxies, volume-limited upto $z=1$ by imposing an $M_I$ cut, we fit parametric models to the histogram of photometric redshifts in order to assign values of overdensity. The figures show chi-squared and gamma functions fitted to the histogram~\citep{Redshift_modelling}.
For our (flux-limited) sample of galaxies, up to $z=1.0$, we fit parametric models to the histogram of photometric redshift in order to assign values of overdensity. Figures show Chi-squared distribution given by
\begin{equation}
 p_1(z) \sim z^{a-1}\exp({-bz})
\end{equation}
and the function given by
\begin{equation}
 p_2(z) \sim z^2\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right)^{1.5}\right)}
\end{equation}
that was first presented by~\cite{Redshift_modelling} as fits to the
redshift histograms. The normalization constants depend not only on the parameters but also on the lower and the upper limit of the redshifts considered. 
\rachel{(To avoid ambiguity, you should use avoid   using the same symbol in both equations.  For example you could turn   the $b$'s into $b_1$ and $b_2$.  Also, the normalization factors out  front do not matter - they are not something that you fit for.  I would say $p(z)\propto$\dots to avoid   the need for a normalization for which you are not actually fitting.)} 
\arun{Done.}
Here $a,b$ and $z_0$ are free parameters that are to be determined.
%\rachel{You cannot expect people to look these up.  Give them equations in which you define $p(z)$ for each case, with labels like $p_1(z)$ and $p_2(z)$.}
For low $z$, the volume is too small to rely the overdensity values from our model fits and hence the fit is made for $z \ge 0.3$. Our binning width, $\Delta z$ must be small enough so as to be able to identify localized overdensities/underdensities but large enough to not let our conclusions be affected by the errors in photometric redshift. 
We choose our bins to be $0.05$ wide starting from $z=0.3$. 
%\rachel{Were you going to use other fitting functions as a test of the method?  If so, you should introduce them here.}

%The curves are normalized such that the area under the curves is equal to the number of galaxies considered. - no longer true if not using fithist.c

Overdensity in a redshift bin is defined as the ratio of the
difference between the value given by the histogram and the value
predicted by the model to the latter:
\begin{equation}
\delta_{g,\text{1D}}=\frac{(N-N_{\text{mod}})}{N_{\text{mod}}}.  
\end{equation}
%(\rachel{This $\delta$ definition is important, so it should be in an equation environment.})
(\rachel{Call it $\delta_{g,\text{1D}}$, not $\delta$, which implies matter
  overdensity.  Better yet would be $\delta_{g,1D}$, to clearly
  indicate this is based on a 1-dimensional slice through redshift
  space rather than isolating 3D overdensities.})
We leave a 10\% margin of safety i.e. iff $\delta_{g,\text{1D}}$ from both the fits is greater than $0.1$, then we call that redshift bin as an
overdense region whereas if $\delta_{g,\text{1D}}$ from both the fits is less than $-0.1$, then we call that as an underdense region. Redshift bins with $-0.1 < \delta_{g,\text{1D}} < 0.1$ are neither too overdense
nor too underdense and we call them as `neutral regions'.

% \begin{figure}
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig4}
%  \label{fig:comoving_densities}
%  \caption{Differential comoving densities, integrated within a bin, are plotted. Red line refers to the average comoving density over the entire volume under consideration. 
%           The green lines correspond to the 0.9 and 1.1 times the overall average.}
% \end{figure}

We thus identify the regions $z=0.30-0.40, 0.65-0.75, 0.80-0.85$ as overdense, $z=0.55-0.65, 0.75-0.80$ as underdense and $z=0.40-0.55$ as unclassified. Although, the $z=0.40-0.55$ bin
appears to be underdense, for reasons mentioned in \S\ref{sub:volumelimiting}, we will not call them underdense.

Our classification is not very rigorous since it considers only the counts in redshift slices and compares with models that only approximately describe the redshift distribution of galaxies.
Moreover, the photometric redshifts become less accurate as we go to higher redshifts (cf.~\S\ref{S:data}) and no information about structure in transverse direction has been taken into account.
Thus, it is important to cross-check with a more careful study of the density fields in the same field of view.
~\cite{Kovac_Density10k}, using a sample of $\sim 10,000$ zCOSMOS spectra sources with $I_{AB}<22.5$, have reconstructed the three dimensional overdensity field up to $z\sim 1$.
In spite of the above mentioned shortcomings, our classification of overdensities and underdensities agrees with this work done, except for the last two high redshift bins.
We believe that this disagreement is due to the errors in our photometric redshifts and the overdensity reported in $z=0.875-1$ slice
is observed by us in $z=0.80-0.85$ slice.

However, the other point to keep in mind here is that what we are
doing most closely follows the way the COSMOS galaxies would be used
when constructing a simulation to test weak lensing measurement
methods: the sample would be divided into redshift slices using the
photometric redshifts, and the shear calibration would be estimated
for all galaxies in that slice.  Thus, it is the apparent over- and
under-densities in such a procedure that we care about here (where our
main concern is testing systematics in weak lensing survey
simulations, rather than learning about galaxy formation and
evolution).

COSMOS is a flux-limited survey and is therefore affected by Malmquist bias, i.e. at higher redshifts, the brighter galaxies are preferentially observed.
Our analysis involves comparing galaxies in different redshift slices to find significant differences in morphology, if any, so with a flux-limited sample, we would be comparing only the bright galaxies at high redshifts with
bright and faint galaxies at low redshifts. For a fair comparison, we must restrict ourselves to bright galaxies at all redshifts and this is acheived by volume-limiting the sample.
%\rachel{Explain why you are doing this.  Before saying {\em how} you
%  generate a volume-limited sample, explain {\em why} you are
%  generating one.}
We generate, using the method below, a volume-limited sample that is complete upto $z=1$ by applying a cut on luminosity such that only galaxies instrinsically brighter than a certain threshold is considered. This threshold is set on $K$-corrected $F814W$-band magnitudes, denoted as $M_\text{F814W}$.
\rachel{Is it $i$ band, or $I$ band?  Check which one and then be
  self-consistent throughout the text.}\arun{I think they call it
  $I_{814}$, so $I$.}
\rachel{But you are still being ambiguous in sometimes calling it $I$
  and other times F814W.  Pick one.}
Since the parent sample contains fainter galaxies, upto $m_\text{F814W}=25.2$, we compare the distribution of the $m_\text{F814W}=23.5$ sample with the samples containing fainter galaxies for high redshift bins, to see where the sample is no longer complete.

At $M_\text{F814W}\sim-22.0$, we see the sample is beginning to be biased in the $0.9<z<1.0$ bin due to the flux limit. We obtain 97.84\% completeness in this bin for $M_\text{F814W}$, where completeness is defined as the ratio between the number of galaxies in $m_\text{F814W}\le 23.5$ and in $m_\text{F814W}\le25.2$ samples.
Thus the sample $z\le1$ and $M_\text{F814W}<-22$ is at least 97.84\% complete. Fig.~\ref{fig:2Dhist} shows that at $M_\text{F814W}<-22$, we are not affected by flux limit yet. 

%We see that the region between $0.85<z<1.0$ is neither overdense nor underdense according to our model and hence is not going to be considered for further analysis.
The region between $0.85<z<1.0$ is only moderately overdense and we do not seem to have as many underdense regions to compare with. It would rather be advantageous to disregard this region
and redo the volume limiting procedure.
We relax our luminosity cut %to $-20.8$
so that the sample is volume-limited \emph{not} until $z=1$ but until $z=0.85$. 
We choose to impose the cut at $M_\text{F814W}=-20.8$, with 95.3\% completeness in the $0.8 < z \le 0.85$ bin. This increases the sample size significantly, from 7,418 galaxies to 11,169. We call this sample \s$1$.

However, previous studies {\bf cite} have shown that absolute luminosities evolve with redshift. Thus, we must also let the luminosity cut evolve with the redshift. 
There has been no published literature on the LF for the $I$-band, particularly for the COSMOS survey.
We used the published result~\citep{Faber2007} for the `rate' of evolution of B-band magnitudes for DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys, which is $ \Delta M_B^* \sim -1.23$ mag per unit redshift, for both blue and red galaxies combined together.
Typically, estimates of evolution in K-band are lesser than the estimates of evolution in B and V bands.
Assuming that the evolution is a smooth function of the wavelength, the evolution in I-band is expected to be lesser than that of the B-band. 
Therefore, by considering no evolution and an upper bound on the evolution, we can interpolate what the results would be like for the true $I$-band evolution.

Thus, we construct a second volume-limited sample \s$2$, this time by letting the luminosity cut evolve. Starting from $M_\text{F814W} = -20.8$ for the $0.8<z\le0.85$ bin, we add to it $1.23$ times the difference between the
bincenters to obtain the luminosity cut for the other (lower) redshift bins. At lower redshifts, we allow for fainter galaxies that wouldn't have passed the cut in \s$1$ and hence has more galaxies.

%In our analysis, we imposed the cut on luminosity for all redshift bins while many studies have shown that the characteristic luminosity of galaxies evolve with redshift. 
% The work that is at least close to what we expect is that of
%~\cite{Faber2007}, who have studied the evolution of Schechter parameters in the B-band of DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys. We consider their reported value of $ \Delta M_B^* \sim -1.23$ per unit redshift, for both blue and red galaxies combined together.
%Although it is the $I$-band that is of relevance to us, we expect the evolution in B-band to be an upper bound on the evolution in I-band. 


%Alternatively, we can impose cuts on stellar mass of the galaxies instead of imposing on the luminosity. 
%If we restrict to galaxies with masses $M$ such that $\log(M/M_\odot) \ge 10.15$, then we have at least {\bf 95.0\% } completeness.
Alternatively, one could get around the problem of considering redshift evolution by imposing cuts on stellar mass instead of absolute luminosity in a particular band. In Fig.~\ref{fig:smf}, we show the stellar mass function (SMF) of our sample for various F814W flux limit.
\cite{Tomczak_SMF} report the SMFs for the ZFOURGE survey, which includes COSMOS. They considered for this work, a single stellar population following a Chabrier IMF~\citep{ChabrierIMF}. 
We plot their SMF for \emph{all} in Fig.~\ref{fig:smf} for
reference. Their SMF is higher than ours since they reach $K_s$-band
$5\sigma$ depth of 24.9. 
As in the case of $M_\text{F814W}$ s, we compare the stellar mass in the $m_\text{F814W}\le23.5$ sample with that of the $m_\text{F814W}\le25.2$ sample. 
The sample $\log(M/M_\odot) > 10.15$ is about 95\% complete in the redshift bin $\left[ 0.75 - 0.85\right]$ and has 10,341 galaxies in total.
Thus, we construct a third volume-limited sample \s$3$ by imposing the stellar mass cut mentioned above. The number of galaxies in redshift slices
are tabulated in Table \ref{table:GalaxyCounts} for all 3 ways of obtaining a volume-limited sample. Stellar-mass limited sample happens to be the smallest one.

There is a minor pitfall with this method. We analyse only those galaxies for which postage stamp images exist.
12\% of galaxies that pass our cuts do not have an associated postage stamp image.
Yet, we use the full $m_\text{F814W}\le23.5$ sample, irrespective of the existence of postage stamps, for identifying overdensities and in the completeness calculation for volume-limiting.
%\rachel{What do you mean we use the full sample  $<23.5$?  For what purpose?  We obviously don't use it for the fits  or shape estimates, so be specific.}
%\arun{Added saying we use the full sample for overdensity calculation and for volume-limiting.}
Postage stamps may not exist because, given the size of the galaxy, the size of the postage stamp we want to draw around it (including enough blank space) intersects with the edge of the CCD.
If all galaxies were the same size, this would be a purely random effect, but in fact bigger galaxies are more likely to get excluded by this cut. 
Typically galaxies that are nearby and intrinsically very bright do not have postage stamps associated with them and this is an effect that is dominant at lower redshifts. 
Our completeness calculation is done at high redshifts and thus we believe that our conclusions are not affected by this bias. 

%Not surprisingly, we see the overdense and underdense regions obtained by the above method have local average number density higher than the global average number density after volume limiting. %Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:comoving_densities}.
%And the environmentally neutral regions fall below or at least lie close to the 10\% margin.
%Refitting the model to our new sample is consistent with the previous assignment of overdensities.

The functional forms for the (flux-limited) redshift distribution that we used in \S\ref{sub:overdensities} are not physically motivated. We fit them again to the  
redshift distribution of a volume-limited sample (\s$1$). Referring to Fig.~\ref{fig:redshift_vollimited}, the values of $\delta_{g,\text{1D}}$ for the $z=0.40-0.55$ bin have increased and are within $\pm 10\%$ of 0. This is the reason why in \S\ref{sub:overdensities} we classified them as neutral as opposed to underdense.
We will see in \S\ref{S:results} that they are more similar to overdense regions as opposed to underdense regions.
The other redshift slices seem to exhibit a consistent behavior.

\subsection{Describing galaxy morphology and shape}
\label{sub:axisratio}

% \rachel{As we discussed, you should get rid of the early parts of this
%   regarding second moments, and replace it with a brief description of
%   what shape estimates we use from GalSim (re-Gaussianization).}
% 
% {\bf Should explain in brief Claire's work.} \\

\rachel{In my opinion, given that the main results are from Claire's
  fits, you should describe those {\em first} and then put the
  re-Gaussianization description second.  Also, state this plan up
  front, i.e., something like ``To describe galaxy morphology and
  shape, we will use fits to Sersic profiles. (\dots description here
  \dots)  However, as a secondary check on the results, we will use \dots''}

If galaxies have elliptical isophotes, its shape and size could be defined by the axis ratio and the area enclosed by a boundary isophote. However, in real galaxy images,
the boundary may not be well defined and the shape may not be well approximated by an ellipse. More importantly, the effect of smearing due to the point-spread function (PSF) is larger. 
% Given the surface brightness (intensity) $I(\vec{\theta})$ of a galaxy image at every angular position $\vec{\theta}$,
% we can define the tensor of second brightness moments as
% \begin{equation}
%  Q_{ij} = \frac{\int\rmd^2\theta q_I (\theta_i - \overline{\theta_i})(\theta_j - \overline{\theta_j})}{\int\rmd^2\theta q_I},
% \end{equation}
% where $q_I$ is a suitable chosen kernel and $\overline{\vec{\theta}}$ is the average angular coordinate, weighted by the same kernel function and $i,j\in\lbrace 1,2 \rbrace$ are the components of $\vec{\theta}$.
% It is common to find in literature two kinds of \emph{complex }ellipticities that quantify the shape of the galaxies - $\chi$ and $\epsilon$ defined as
% \begin{align}
%  \chi &= \frac{Q_{11}-Q_{12}+2iQ_{12}}{Q_{11}+Q_{22}} \\ \epsilon &= \frac{Q_{11}-Q_{22}+2iQ_{12}}{Q_{11}+Q_{22}+2(Q_{11}Q_{22}-Q_{12})^{1/2}}
% \end{align}
% If the image has elliptical isophotes with axis ratio $q$, then 
% \begin{equation}
%  |\chi| = \frac{1-q^2}{1+q^2}, \;\;\; |\epsilon| = \frac{1-q}{1+q}. 
% \end{equation}
% 
% 
% Conversely, one could compute $\chi$ or $\epsilon$ for a galaxy, and obtain an effective, azimuthally averaged {\bf(?)} axis-ratio $q$. 
% \rachel{No, that isn't possible because of the PSF.  One would have to
%   use a PSF correction scheme.  Recommend removing much of the above discussion.}
% \arun{Should I remove these even if we plan to use the ellipticities from the second moments?} 

The PSF correction scheme used on the observed images is that of `re-Gaussianization' method described in \S 2.4 of~\cite{HS03} (hereafter HS03).
This method models the true PSF $g({\bf x})$ as a Gaussian $G({\bf x})$ and the residual $\epsilon({\bf x}) = g({\bf x}) - G({\bf x})$ is assumed to be small. Thus, the Gaussian-convolved
intrinsic image of $f$, is $I' = G\otimes f = I - \epsilon \otimes f$, where $I$ is the observed image. The crucial idea here is that, when $\epsilon$ is small, we get a reasonably accurate
estimate of $I'$ even if we use an approximate form for $f$. The form assumed for $f$ is that of a Gaussian with covariance $M_f^{(0)} = M_I - M_g$, where $M_I$ and $M_g$ are the adaptive
covariances of the measured object and PSF respectively, described in \S 2.1 of HS03, which is in turn based on~\cite{BJ02}. Once we obtain the covariance matrices of the instrinsic image $f$, one can compute the ellipticities 
of the galaxies, which we will refer to as `ellipticities based on moments'.

Another method of estimate the ellipticities is to fit parametric models to each image. Two examples of the models are
\begin{enumerate}
 \item a \sersic profile given by the expression 
       \begin{equation} 
    S = \Sigma_{1/2}\exp{\left( -k(R/R_{\text{eff}})^{1/n} -1 \right)},
       \end{equation}
       \item two \sersic component fits: de Vaucoulers bulge $(n=4)$ + exponential disc profile $(n=1)$,
\end{enumerate}
where \begin{align*} R^2 = & ((x-x_0)\cos\Phi+(y-y_0)\sin\Phi)^2  \\ & + ((y-y_0)\cos\Phi-(x-x_0)\sin\Phi)^2/q^2, \end{align*}
$R_{\text{eff}}$ is the half-light radius of the profile, $\Sigma_{1/2}$ is the surface brightness at $R=R_{\text{eff}}$, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the centroid of the image,
$\Phi$ is the profile rotation angle, $n$ is the \sersic index, $k$ is a $n$-dependent normalization factor and $q$ is the axis ratio of the elliptical isophotes.
Thus, the \sersic profile has 7 free parameters. The bulge+disk model has 10 free parameters since the \sersic indices are fixed as 1 and 4
and both the profiles are required to have the same centroid $(x_0,y_0)$. Best-fit parameters were found, by minimizing the weighted
sum of the difference between the image and the PSF-convolved mode
using Levenberg-Marquardt minimization, \texttt{mpfit2fun} in IDL~\citep{mpfit2fun}. More details about the fit can be found
in~\cite{Claire_Fits}.

The quantities that we would use from the single \sersic profile fits are the \sersic index and axis ratio
and from the bulge+disk fits will be the \btt ratio given by ${\Sigma_{1/2}(n=4)}/{\left(\Sigma_{1/2}(n=4)+\Sigma_{1/2}(n=1)\right)}$.

\section{Results}
\label{S:results}
Having identified the overdense and underdense regions in a volume-limited sample (\S\ref{sub:overdensities}, \S\ref{sub:volumelimiting}), we will now see in this section if the morphological
parameters of the galaxies, listed in \S\ref{sub:axisratio}, have any dependence on the environment that they reside in. We have 3 different ways of volume-limiting our sample
\begin{enumerate}
 \item no redshift evolution of luminosity cut $(\s1)$,
 \item use $B$-band evolution rate for $I$-band luminosities $(\s2)$,
 \item impose stellar mass cuts instead of luminosity $(\s3)$
\end{enumerate}
and we will present our results in each of the 3 cases. 
\rachel{Say how this connects to the 3 samples S1, S2, and S3 that you defined earlier.} \arun{Done.}

\rachel{I also recommend splitting this section up into subsections so
  it's not just one big block.  For example, the first can be about
  axis ratios (with a subsubsection about how the results depend on
  the way the volume limiting was carried out), the second can be
  about morphology from Sersic index and bulge-to-total ratios.}

\end{figure*}

We can understand the influence of environment on the ellipticities of the galaxies simply by comparing the distribution of the axis ratios for the overdense and underdense samples. 
%The distribution of the axis ratios that are obtained by the above manner are compared between redshift bins. 
We use two statistical tests namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Anderson-Darling test to compare distributions.

We first compare the distribution of the axis ratio in \emph{all}
overdense bins and \emph{all} underdense bins in Fig.~\ref{fig:axisratio_all}.
\rachel{How was the volume-limiting carried out for this?  You should say the answer to this question  for all figures.} 
\arun{The caption mentions it.}
Unless otherwise mentioned, the axis ratios refer to the values obtained using the method of~\cite{Claire_Fits}.
The cumulative distinction functions are also plotted alongside in order to be able to visualize the `distance' between the distributions.
Referring to the first two rows in Table~\ref{table:pvalues_all}, we see that the p-values from both the KS and AD tests are well below 0.05
(\rachel{give the actual numbers!} 
\arun{It's in the table.} 
\rachel{The text does not seem to mention the table at all.  If thereaders are to get the numbers from it, then you need to refer to it here and any other place where it is relevant.}), 
\arun{Done.}
so we reject the `null hypothesis' that the overdense and underdense regions have same axis ratio distributions at 95\% significance level.

One might imagine that the disagreement between the distributions is, at least partly, due to the fact that the overdense and underdense sample have different redshift distributions.
To show that that is not the case, we will compare distributions between two overdense / underdense redshift bins, where we expect to find similarity, and between an overdense and underdense regions,
where we expect the distributions to differ.
Figures~\ref{fig:axisratio_similar} and~\ref{fig:axisratio_contrasting} are examples showing that the distributions are indeed similar when the environments are similar and different when the environments are different, confirming our expectation.
Similar conclusion can be arrived at by comparing other redshift bins.

%The shape of a population of galaxies can be characterized by a single number called `RMS ellipticity'. If $q=b/a$ is the axis-ratio, then the ellipticity maybe defined as $\frac{1-q}{1+q}$
%or as $\frac{1-q^2}{1+q^2}$. The root mean squared (RMS) of ellipticities of galaxies in each redshift bin are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rms_ellip}.
It is useful to consider the root mean square ellipticity, a statistic that can characterize the shape of the population/sample of galaxies.
For the luminosity-selected sample without any evolution, RMS ellipticities of galaxies in each redshift bin are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rms_ellip}. As one can see, the underdense regions
have significantly higher values for RMS ellipticities when compared to the overdense regions. Note in particular that we've been able to capture the narrow overdense bin $0.75\le z < 0.80$.  
There is (almost) no redshift dependence in the figure.

The dependence on the local environment seems to make sense. Overdense regions typically have young, spiral galaxies which have high $q$ and hence low RMS ellipticity. 
On the contrary, the underdense regions typically have old, elliptical galaxies and thus low $q$ and high RMS ellipticity.

From Figs.~\ref{fig:redshift_fluxlimited} and~\ref{fig:redshift_vollimited},
the region $0.4\le z < 0.55$ show signs of being marginally underdense but have low RMS ellipticities too that agree with the rest of the overdense regions.

When the B-band luminosity evolution is taken into account in selecting the sample, a systematic increase in the ellipticity at lower redshifts can be observed. We plot these alongside with stellar-mass selected samples, where a similar trend is found, in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_ellip_Bband_mass}. 
Such a trend is not observed in axis ratios based on second moments. 
For other morphological parameters, we do not the distributions themselves directly. For \sersic profile fits, it gets tricky since we truncate the \sersic index at 6. 
For \btt ratios, we force the value to be greater than 0.05 \arun{What exactly do we do here?}. We will understand the dependence of these quantities on environment by computing the median values in different redshift bins.
We choose median over mean since it is more robust to the truncation effects.
Figure(s) \ref{fig:median_sersicn} show the median of the \sersic index with and without taking into account of the luminosity evolution. Median values obtained using stellar mass selected samples are plotted alongside for reference.
We observe that the overdense regions tend to have higher \sersic index than the adjacent underdense ones.
Figure(s) \ref{fig:median_dvcbtt} show the variation of median \btt ratio with redshift. We see that the bulge component is more in overdense regions than in the underdense regions.
These two observations are consistent with each other since higher \sersic index implies higher bulge component which are typical in young galaxies found in overdense regions.
%We chose median over mean since \sersic n greater than 6 are truncated to 6. This affects the mean statistic more than the median.
